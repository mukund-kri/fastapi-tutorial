# Pre-requisites

## Python

You will need a fairly recent version of Python. At least 3.8 or later. We recommend
python 3.10.x.

We also recommend using `pyenv` to manage your python versions. This way your are
not constrained to the version of python that comes with your operating system.
Switching between python versions is also very easy.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zgo8M9yUtM) gives a good overview of
`pyenv` installation and usage on Ubuntu.

## Python Features

FastAPI being a modern python framework, it uses some of the latest python features
like:

1. Type annotations
2. `async` and `await` syntax
3. dataclasses

If you are not familiar with these features, please stop here and learn them first.

## Ubuntu

We use Ubuntu and most of the commands in this tutorial are for Ubuntu. If you are
using a different operating system, you will need to adapt the commands to your OS.
